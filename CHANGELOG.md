# Changelog

All notable changes to DAGrail are documented here. The project follows Semantic Versioning while pre-1.0 APIs remain explicitly scoped by their stability labels.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-14

### Added

- immutable, content-derived Execution Packages with candidate, prospective-tree,
  command-graph, protected-input, observation, artifact, and provenance bindings;
- deterministic, policy-bound Reuse Decisions that distinguish policy-only changes
  from protected-core changes without claiming semantic approval;
- `evidence.publish` and `evidence.assess-reuse` allowed actions, bounded context refs,
  `dagrail evidence list`, and package/decision inspection;
- SQLite projection schema v3 with evidence and reuse indexes plus v1/v2 migrations;
- replay-time verification of package IDs, core digests, decision results, and reason codes.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-14

### Added

- backward-compatible mixed-version journal reading;
- explicit event schema versions and deterministic in-memory upcasting;
- journal compatibility reporting;
- serialized SQLite projection schema migrations, transient-lock safety, and
  segment-schema provenance;
- immutable compatibility fixtures and fail-closed future-version tests.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-14

### Added

- initial typed DAG control kernel, journal, projections, CLI, MCP, effects, plugins, skills, and hooks.
